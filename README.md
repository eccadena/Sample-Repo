# Sample-Repo
I am a sample repo.

Find a location (folder) on your computer to "pull" me down into.

This will create a folder (more-or-less is the repository) and place all my contents there.

First, use the ssh link for downloading the repo.

Go to the CLI, and use git clone <link>.

Thats it.

From here we will create a folder, a file, write to the file.

Then we must.

git status

git commit

git push origin master

Check the website that it is there.
